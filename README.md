# OpenSesame

This app is extremely simple and just hits a single URL that can be hooked up to any number of services.  For example this system was created to hit an Arduino hooked up to our door buzzer allowing for keyless access (hence the name).   

I'm working on a blog post detailing how the system was built and wired up.  Once complete I'll link to that system from here.  

Stay tuned.
